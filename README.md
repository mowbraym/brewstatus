# Brewstat.us

## Introduction
The Brewstat.us Plugin allows CraftBeerPi 3.0 to send Temperature and Gravity sensor data, and a comment to Brewstat.us

## Use
1. Download this Plugin from CraftBeerPi 3 Add-On page
2. Under Parameters add your brewstatus_url (The Cloud URL from the Tilt settings page of brewstat.us) and (optionally) a Comment to add to your posts.
3. Restart CraftBeerPi

## Important Note
Multiple Tilt devices are supported. It is important that your Tilt sensors are listed in the correct order for this plugin to work. Each Tilt colour requires two sensors, with the Temperature sensor listed before the Gravity sensor, and no other coloured Tilt sensors between.
